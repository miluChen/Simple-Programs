# linked-lists
The C implementation of linked lists is based on "Data Structures, an Advanced Approach Using C" by Esakov and Weiss.
A "sort" function (recursive merge sort version) is added, which can sort the list in O(nlgn) time and O(lgn) space.

It seems many ideas (e.g. abstraction, polymorphism, etc.) in C++ actually come from this book.
